## Issue Summary

## Duration
Start Time: January 19, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
End Time: January 19, 2024, 2:45 PM (UTC)

## Impact
Turned our User Authentication Service into a 'No-Entry Zone'
Users performed the login dance but were left in the waiting room
Approximately 15% of users received an unexpected comedy show

## Timeline

## Detection Time
January 19, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)

## How Detected
Monitoring alert popped up like an unsolicited laugh track in a sitcom

## Actions Taken
Initial investigation felt like searching for a needle in a haystack, only to realize it was a banana peel
Assumed initial hypothesis: Database doing stand-up comedy with connectivity issues

## Misleading Paths
Thought our servers were playing hide and seek with the database, turns out, they just needed a good pep talk
Contemplated a DDoS attack, but it was just users eagerly hitting the login button
## Escalation
Called the DevOps and Database teams to join the comedy festival after our solo act failed

## Resolution

Identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, akin to setting up a punchline but forgetting the delivery
Load balancer was distributing traffic like a one-liner that only a few got, causing authentication failures for some users
Adjusted load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic, creating a harmonious laughter track
						## Root Cause and Resolution

## Root Cause
Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings – our servers wanted to be comedians, not traffic cops

## Resolution
Load balancer settings were convinced to share the spotlight equally
Conducted a stand-up meeting to ensure everyone was on the same page, comedy-wise
Implemented additional monitoring to catch load balancer misconfigurations before they turn into a comedy special
						
						## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

## Improvements/Fixes
Scheduled regular comedy nights for load balancer configurations – because laughter is the best medicine
Added automated tests for load balancer functionality – even machines need a sense of humor
Practiced simulated drills with rubber chickens to prepare for future comedic mishaps

## Tasks to Address the Issue
Task 1: Documented and shared the comedic journey with the team – laughter is contagious
Task 2: Installed a 'Comedy Central' dashboard for monitoring load balancer configurations
Task 3: Updated the incident response plan to include load balancer misconfigurations as potential punchlines
Task 4: Organized a comedy workshop for the team – because a happy team is a funny team
Task 5: Performed a comprehensive review of other critical system configurations – no more hidden jokes in the code

						## Conclusion

In the grand comedy of errors that was our web stack outage on January 19, 2024, the mischievous load balancer took the stage, distributing traffic like a stand-up routine gone wrong. The incident, though initially perplexing, was resolved with a touch of humor and a lot of configuration adjustments. This comedic episode highlights the importance of laughter, sorry, I mean regular configuration reviews, automated testing, and continuous improvement in monitoring practices for maintaining a web stack that's not just efficient but also entertaining. After all, who said tech can't be a laughing matter?
